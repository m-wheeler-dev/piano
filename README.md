Sounds and visual effects activate when a key is clicked or the matching key on your keyboard is pressed. 
(Tapping on keys works as clicking for touch screen users)

Built using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript

One of my first interactive projects, it has since been modified to function and scale properly on mobile devices. 

The primary struggle I had with this project was learning how to get everything to activate when the keys were pressed on the keyboard. Before this, all of my event listener / handling experience was with clicking. The original thought and first draft was thanks to a guided tutorial, but I then built it on my own afterwards as I wanted to learn and comprehend as much as I could.
